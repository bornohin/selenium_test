# selenium_test
Just a little hands on snippet on how to use selenium.

The Selenium module needs to be installed on local computer and you must point the chromedriver.exe path inside your code to make it work. While this script is not intended for in-depth testing, getting started with it on my local computer makes me happy. 

Finding the correct ID, class or Xpath tag from HTML is the challenge and rest becomes easy.
